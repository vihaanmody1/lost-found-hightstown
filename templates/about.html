    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Lost & Found @ Hightstown</strong> website! We are a dedicated service for students 
        of Hightstown High School to help reunite lost items with their owners. Whether you've lost something 
        in the classroom, cafeteria, gym, or anywhere on campus, our platform makes it easy to report and 
        find lost belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is to provide a simple, efficient, and transparent way for students to reclaim their 
        lost items. By reporting found items and checking our database, you can help reduce lost property 
        and ensure that valuable items find their way back to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This service is operated by Vihaan Mody & Shourya Pendgaonkar and is free for all Hightstown High School 
        students to use. Together, we can create a more connected and caring school community!
